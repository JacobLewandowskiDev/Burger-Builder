# BurgerBuilder
This is a simple burger ordering app developed in Java. The idea was to use OOP principles 
and parent / child classes to create a app that allows the user to order one of 3 available 
burgers with the possibility to add additional ingredients to them. 

### How to run the app
1. Simply download the file and open it up in your Java IDE

### How to use the app
1. Currently the app has pre-inputed orders for a regular burger, healthy burger and a deluxe set
2. Depending on which burger is chosen the console shall prompt you for information in regards to extras for your burger.
3. Input the correct integar for the corresponding ingredient.
4. After the ingredient has been chosen it will add its price to the total cost of the order
5. If the user decides to finish his order a reciept will be printed into the console.
